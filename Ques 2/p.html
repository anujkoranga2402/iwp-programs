			"1984" is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell, published in 1949. Set in a totalitarian future society, the story follows the life of Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the ruling Party. The Party, led by the enigmatic Big Brother, exercises complete control over every aspect of people's lives, manipulating history, language, and individual thoughts to maintain power.

			Winston becomes disillusioned with the Party's oppressive regime and starts questioning its principles. He secretly begins a forbidden love affair with Julia, a fellow Party member. As Winston's rebellious thoughts and actions increase, he becomes a target of the Party's surveillance and is ultimately captured by the Thought Police.
			
			The novel explores themes of government surveillance, psychological manipulation, and the suppression of individualism. Orwell's haunting portrayal of a society devoid of privacy and freedom serves as a warning against totalitarianism and the dangers of unchecked power. "1984" has become a classic work of dystopian fiction and remains relevant in its critique of authoritarian regimes and the erosion of civil liberties.
